   <p class="special"> My name is Marilyn Guerra. I grew up in San Jose CA and have lived here my whole life. I have a bunch of hobbies, but three of my most favorite are Digital Art, Programming, and Photograpgy!</p>
   <p class="special">Ever since I could remember I have had the love for the arts and an interest in creating something of my own. This love has carried me down the paths of both digital art and programming.
    In art there is no wrong way to create. Therefore this allows me the freedom to create meaningful art without having to worry about any rules or restrictions. 
   </p>
   <p class="special">Now programming is an interesting topic. As a kid I found programming very interesting because I could create websites from scratch and control devices with just a few lines of code. It wasnt until recently that I thought
    about presuing programing as a career and started to study towards it. It is how I made this page in the first place! Pretty neat huh? And I have only had 6 classes!</p>
