      <p class="art-1"> Made on August 25, 2023</p>
      <p class="art-1"> In this picture I drew a goddess praying. My inspiration came from Princess Zelda from the Nintendo game series "The Legend of Zelda". I tried my very best to practice capturing emotion in a still picture. 
        Here you can see there is some worry but also a sense of confidence that her prayer will be answered.</p>
    
        <img class="art2" src="./images/art2.jpg" width="800px">
          <p class="art-2">Made on August 7, 2023</p>
          <p class="art-2">This one is more of a trial and error art piece that turned out really nice. While drawing I challenged myself to not use any refferences, just to draw from memory alone. I also wanted to get out of my comfort zone and
            draw a difficult pose. Thus where this piece came from! All I thought about when drawing this one was Spider-Man and outfits that a skateboader would wear.

        <img class="art3" src="./images/art3.jpg" width="800px">
        <p class="art-3">Made on July 15, 2023</p>
        <p class="art-3">At the start of drawing this picture I had no idea how to draw wings. I have had many attempts that lead to failure in the past, but I was determined to try again. And, just like the last art piece, I decided to 
            challenge myself by not using any references. Now that I have explained, without a doubt this is the piece I am most proud of thus far. The capture of emotion and the wings came out amazing, despite the fact that I did not use reference!
